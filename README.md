# JOKES
In short, our goal is to make an application that pulls the joke according to the category entered from the console with PHP, saves it to the system and displays it on the screen.
 
 
 
 
 - First we create a database named 'chucknorris'
 - We run the setup.php file in the console. ( We are installing the tables that we will use in our database.)
 - Then we run the index.php file in the console
 
 
 
 ## For Example
 - If we run it as ' php index.php ' It will ask that no category is entered and that we enter one of the listed categories.
 - If we run it as ' php index.php animal ' When we enter in this way, it will save the joke belonging to that category to the system and show it on the screen.
